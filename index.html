<h1>Taylor Malott's Personal Website</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I created this website as a portfolio for past and future projects, as I learn new tech tools. This website itself is one of my projects--I am coding it myself in HTML</p>
<p title="Hosting Location">I'm hosting this website with GitHub Pages</p>

<br>
<p>My next step is to reformat this page to be more visually pleaseing. I will be using the excellent tutorial material over at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools.com</a>. Enjoy!</p>
