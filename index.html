            Hi, I'm Taylor. I love camping, and I'm passionate about data analytics and streamlining data processes. <br> <br> I've worked for the last two years in the steel manufacturing industry managing complex data projects. This involved collecting data through collobaration with teams of various departments and synthesizing it into powerful business intelligence visualizations that highlighted key insights to drive business decisions. <br><br>Before that, I worked for several nonprofit organizations and a medical clinic using my Microsoft Excel skills to analyze data and streamline reporting processes. <br><br>I'm an advanced Microsoft Excel user with experience using functions like VLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH, as well as pivot tables, table formatting, and the Power Query add-in. <br><br>I'm an intermediate Power BI designer with experience connecting and relating multiple data sources like Sharepoint folders and CSV files and creating powerful dashboards to summarize business data. <br><br>I am currently learning SQL, Tableau, and Python, and I'm building this website using HTML and CSS.
