<h1>Taylor Malott's Personal Website</h1>
<h2>I created this webstie as a portfolio for past and future projects, as I learn new tech tools. This website itself is one of my projects--I am coding it myself in HTML</h2>
<p>I'm hosting this website with GitHub Pages</p>

<p>My next step is to reformat this page to be prettier. Enjoy!</p>
