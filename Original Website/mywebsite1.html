<p>I'm from north Houston, but I enjoy strolling around the downtown area. Photo credits go to my sister.<img src="IMG_5087.JPG" alt="A building in downtown Houston" style="width: 480px;height:360px;" align="right">

<p>Howdy!
<p>I'm an Aggie Class of 2019 industrial engineering major. I only became and Aggie last year - I took a few years to complete my associate of science degree. Shout out to Lone Star College - University Park! I learned so much here.</p>

<p>Now that I'm here at A&M, I have become involved in several organizations: Grace Bible Church Southwood, the Student Engineer's Council, the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers, and the Aggie Baptist Student Ministry.
I have several years' administration and event planning experience in the nonprofit sector. I currently work as a private contract tutor for math and physics.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I love service and spening time one on one with friends. If I'm on my own, I enjoy any sort of creative activity. Below are a few examples.</p>

<p>I also love anything sci-fi. Below is one of my favorite movie spaceships:</p>

<p>While at Lone Star College, I did a capstone trip to Italy. Part of the purpose for me was to observe the cathedrals there first hand for my research project.
